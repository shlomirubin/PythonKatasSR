To complete this exercise:
--------------------------
Implement the 'can_drive' function to check if a person is eligible to drive. The function should return a message 
indicating if the person meets both conditions: being at least 18 years old and having a valid license.


Exercise Breakdown:
-------------------
The `and` operator in Python is used to combine multiple conditions.
It returns `True` if all conditions are true and `False` otherwise.
This allows you to perform checks that require multiple criteria to be met.

if x == 6 and y > 9:
    print('...')
