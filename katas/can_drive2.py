To complete this exercise:
--------------------------
Implement the 'can_drive' function to check if a person is eligible to drive. 
The function should return a message indicating if the person meets both conditions: being at least 18 and under 65 years old or already have a valid license.


Exercise Breakdown:
-------------------
The `or` operator in Python is used to combine multiple conditions.
It returns `True` if one condition is true and `False` if all conditions are false.

Parentheses are used to group conditions and control the order of evaluation when using `and` and `or` operators.
