To complete this exercise:
--------------------------
Implement the 'split_full_name' function to return the first and last elements as a tuple (first name, last name).


Exercise Breakdown:
-------------------
In python, a `tuple` is a collection of ordered elements. 
It is similar to a list but is immutable (cannot be changed after creation).

When you return multiple values from a function using commas, Python automatically groups them into a tuple. 

For example:

def get_coordinates():
    return 10, 20  # This returns a tuple (10, 20)
