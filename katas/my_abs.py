print(my_abs(-10))  # 10 expected
print(my_abs(5))    # 5 expected
print(my_abs(0))    # 0 expected


"""
To complete this exercise:
--------------------------
Implement the 'my_abs' function to return the absolute value of the given number -
WITHOUT using the built-in abs() function. 

 The absolute value of a number is its non-negative value, so if the number is negative, return its positive counterpart.
If the number is already positive or zero, return it as is.

Exercise Breakdown:
-------------------
Think....
Don't use the `abs()` built in function.
