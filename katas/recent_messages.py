To complete this exercise:
--------------------------
Implement the 'get_recent_messages' function. It should take a list of messages (messages) and a starting index (start_index), then return all messages from that index to the end of the list.

Exercise Breakdown:
-------------------
You can omit the 'stop' value in the slice notation:
